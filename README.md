# Learning from Sub-optimal demonstrations and experience

This project consists on exploring Deep Q-Learning from Demonstrations, and experimening different heuristics to improve learning.

We use the MiniGrid and create trajectories with different levels of optimality by using either pre-trained agents or heuristics as example.
